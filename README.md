# odin-calculator

An online calculator I built as part of The Odin Project series. Built using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript.

## Features

* All basic arithmetic operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide)
* Comes with options to All Clear
* Nice UI design following Apple design language

## Things I learned

* Leverage the use of data-* attributes in HTML as Javascript selectors, reserving classes and IDs for CSS Selectors.
* Various edge cases when it comes to calculator functions.
