# calculator-project

An online calculator I built as part of The Odin Project series. Built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.

## Features

* All basic arithmetic operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide).
* Comes with option to All Clear.
* Nice UI design following Apple design language.

## Things I Learned

* Leverage the use of data-* attributes in HTML as JavaScript selectors, reserving classes and IDs for CSS Selectors.
* Various edge cases when it comes to calculator functions.

Work in Progress to add additional features and refine edge cases.
